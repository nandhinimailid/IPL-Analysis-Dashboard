# IPL-Analysis-Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard delivers a full IPL analysis (2008–2022) with season-wise KPIs like title winner, Orange/Purple Cap, total sixes and fours. It provides detailed batting and bowling stats with filters, plus visuals on toss impact, venue wins, team wins, and result types. Built in Power BI with advanced DAX and flexible data source connection.


# Project Purpose

This dashboard was built to serve as a complete analytical solution for the Indian Premier League (IPL), covering data from the 2008–2022 seasons. Its primary goal is to translate raw match, player, and season-level data into meaningful insights that can support informed decision-making for stakeholders such as the BCCI, franchise owners, coaching staff, analysts, and even general cricket fans.

The report showcases season-specific insights, highlighting key outcomes like the championship team, Orange Cap and Purple Cap winners, and overall boundary counts. It also includes in-depth player-level analysis, enabling users to explore batting and bowling performance for individual athletes across multiple seasons. Beyond player metrics, the dashboard visualizes broader trends such as toss influence on match results, team win distributions across venues, and season-by-season team performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to address client problem statements by combining data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visuals to provide a clear, data-driven picture of IPL history.


# Key Highlights:
Interactive Filters – Select Season & Player (Batsman/Bowler) to explore stats.
DAX Insights – Used advanced DAX to calculate batting strike rates, 4s, 6s, wickets, averages, and economy rates.
Visual Storytelling – Title winner, Orange Cap & Purple Cap stats, tournament 4s/6s, and toss decision impact.
Comparative Analysis – Matches won by venue, team-wise seasonal wins, and win distribution by result type.


# Learnings & Skills Gained:
 ✔ Building calculated columns & measures in DAX.
 ✔ Creating percentage share insights (e.g., win by runs vs wickets).
 ✔ Using slicers for season/year and player-level drilldowns.
 ✔ Designing user-friendly dashboards with custom visuals & KPIs.
This project really helped me deepen my understanding of data modeling, DAX calculations, and storytelling with Power BI.
